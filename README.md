# Opinionated Laravel Template

This is a template I use when starting a new Laravel project. It is opinionated and uses the conventions I prefer to work with day-in, day-out.

## Installation

You can create a new project via composer:

```bash
composer create-project oliverservin/laravel-template
```

## Toolset

The created application is configured with the following tools:

- [Laravel Folio](https://github.com/livewire/volt)
- [Livewire Volt](https://github.com/laravel/folio)
- [Pest PHP](https://pestphp.com)
- [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Prettier On a Laravel](https://helgesver.re/articles/laravel-blade-formatter-prettier)
